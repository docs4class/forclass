## R Markdown

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
data("storms")
head(storms)
```

1. Create a variable called `inch.pressure` which is the pressure converted to inches.  What is the average `inch.pressure` for storms greater than category 3?

```{r}
q1 <- storms %>% 
  mutate(inch.pressure = (pressure*0.0393701)) %>% 
  filter(category>3) %>% 
  summarise(mean(inch.pressure))
q1
```

2. How many storms are category 1, 2, or 5?

```{r}
q2 <- storms %>% 
  mutate(inch.pressure = (pressure*0.0393701)) %>% 
  filter(category>3) %>% 
  summarise(mean(inch.pressure))
q2
```
