# Practicing with `mtcars` data set

This demonstration is based on the datasset `mtcars`.

1. Read in `mtcars`
```{r}
data(mtcars)
```


2. View first few rows and last few rows of mtcars dataframe using functions `head()` and `tail()`
```{r}
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars)
```



3. Some info about mtcars dataframe using function `colnames()`, `rownames()`, and `dim()`
```{r}
colnames(mtcars)
rownames(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
```

## Excerises for you:

1. Find the minimum and maximum value of `mpg` 
2. Find the mean and standard deviation of data variable `mpg` 
3. What variable has a 3rd quartile value of 180.0? 
4. Create this figure

```{r, echo=FALSE}
attach(mtcars)
plot(wt,mpg)
```

5. Create and explain what this means

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars)
```

6. Create and explain what this means

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.dim = c(3, 2)}
cor(mtcars)
```

7. Create a variable called `efficiency` which is mpg divided by weight.  Which car has the max `efficiency` and what is this value?
8. Which variable in this dataset has the greatest standard deviation?
9. How many cars have 3 gears?
10. How many cars get more than 17 mpg?
