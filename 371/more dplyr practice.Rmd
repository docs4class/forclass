## Excersises

Open the `storms` data from the `dplyr` package.  Use `?storms` to understand the data.  Then answer:

1. How many observations have both wind speeds of greater than 20 knots and air pressure of more 1010 millibars? 
2. How many observations have the storm name of Ana, Ernesto, Ophelia or Isidore? 
3. What is the average wind speed for each category of storm? 
4. For category 4 and 5 storms (combined) what is the average pressure? 
5. Create a variable called strength which is pressure divided by wind speed.  What is the maximum strength in this data set? 

Using the `nycflights13` dataset and the `dplyr` package, answer these questions.  Some answers are given in square brackets for you to check your answers.
